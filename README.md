# Time Complexity

### In this Repo I have explained **Time Complexity** in simpler terms.

### The topic is discussed and explained using **Jupyter Notebook**.It is so that we can compare and analyse execution time for a better understanding.

### **Note** : *You need to paste the file link in **[nbviewer Website](https://nbviewer.org/)** to run this file.If you are not able to see the execution time then it is advised to use **VS Code** to run the file.*

### **Note** : *Run this notebook before going through it.*
